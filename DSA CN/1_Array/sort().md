The unexpected result of arr.sort() occurs because, by default, the sort() method in JavaScript converts the elements of the array to strings and then compares their Unicode code point values.

Here's the breakdown:
Each number in the array is treated as a string during the sort.
These "strings" are compared lexicographically (like dictionary order).
For example:
"2" comes before "23".
"3" comes before "34".
"5" comes before "54".
Hence, the array is sorted as if it contained strings, not numbers.
Solution:
To sort the array numerically, you need to provide a comparison function to the sort() method. For example:

javascript
Copy code
arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
console.log(arr);
Explanation of the comparison function:
(a, b) => a - b
If the result is negative (a < b), a comes before b.
If the result is positive (a > b), b comes before a.
If the result is 0, their order remains unchanged.
Correct Output:
javascript
Copy code
[ 2, 3, 3, 5, 7, 23, 34, 54 ]

The sort() method in JavaScript does not specify a guaranteed algorithm in its official ECMAScript specification. However, most JavaScript engines, like V8 (used in Chrome and Node.js), use Timsort for the sort() method.

Key Points About Timsort:
What is Timsort?

Timsort is a hybrid sorting algorithm derived from Merge Sort and Insertion Sort.
It is optimized for real-world data patterns, particularly for partially sorted data.
Why Timsort?

Timsort works efficiently on data that has pre-existing order (partially sorted).
It provides O(n log n) performance in the average and worst cases.
It performs very well on nearly sorted or small datasets, often approaching O(n) in the best case.
Characteristics of JavaScript's sort():
Stable Sort: Starting from ES2019, the sort() method guarantees a stable sort in all JavaScript engines.
Stable sort means that if two elements are considered equal by the comparison function, their original order is preserved.
Customizable Sorting Logic: You can specify a custom comparator function, making the algorithm adaptable to various needs.
Summary:
Algorithm Used: Typically Timsort (for modern engines like V8, SpiderMonkey, and JavaScriptCore).
Performance:
Average/Worst Case: O(n log n)
Best Case (for nearly sorted arrays): O(n)
Stable Sorting: Guaranteed from ES2019 onwards.
If you're curious about the implementation for a specific JavaScript engine, you can refer to the engine's source code (e.g., V8's implementation).
